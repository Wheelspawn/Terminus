# Terminus
A console-based roguelike in C++. Combines elements of Rogue, Dragon Warrior, and other RPGs.
This project is mostly bits and pieces right now, and the current code is quite poorly written. I made a midpoint displacement algorithm to generate a random map of fixed size, but I've now decided that I want to do everything on the fly. I'm looking into Perlin noise to do this, and I'll probably have the basic shell of terrain generation, player movement, NPC spawning and basic combat by the end of summer at most. I also want to use navmeshes for pathfinding and Prim's algorithm for maze generation.
