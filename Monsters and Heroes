Qualities of Magic:
Damage
Damage type, e.g. shock, fire, poison
Range (1-3)
Hits on targets (1 to all in area of effect)
MP drainage (depends on skill level, area of effect, recent use of MP and potions used to enhance MP)

Magic has an area of effect, so a cast of range 2 would affect areas

~ V ~ ~ ~
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
~ ~ @ ~ ~
~ ~ ~ ~ D
~ ~ ~ D ~

Bow attacks are not magic attacks, but use a ranged attack to effect 1 target per turn, and the attacks consume arrows
Bow has a hits on targets quality as well, as there is a probability between 0 and 1 of hitting the target, and the accuracy depends on skill levels
Magic is used best against groups of attackers, while bows and melee weapons work best against single opponents

Mobs respawn after 15 turns if they are four steps away from the player's line-of-sight, with the exception of hermits, citizens, fighters and keepers
Fighters and keepers stay within range of their fortresses

Cambions and archdemons are the most powerful monsters in the game, and only found in areas exclusively reserved for undead
